sample-project
==============

*A sample project using AgularJS and Firebase*

This is a very simple HTTP link storage system. There are two views: a list of links and a form to create and edit links.


###Installation###
To get this sample project up and running on your computer just follow these quick steps.

 - Download the latest version of Node.js on your computer from http://nodejs.org/
 - Install Node.js on your local computer 
 - Clone this repository https://github.com/omniboard/sample-project into a folder on your computer
 - Browse to that directory using a Terminal or Command window
 - Start the webserver using the command: `node webserver.js`
 - Open your browser of choice and point it at http://localhost:8000/index.html
 - If all goes well, you should see a list of links from our sample database
 

###Customization###
Once you have the sample project working on your computer, you MUST perform the following modifications to demonstrate your basic familiarity with the involved frameworks.
 - Create your own Firebase at http://www.firebase.com.
 - Modify the sample application to point to your firebase instead of our sample database
 - Create a list of links in your Firebase using the sample application in your browser
 - Place a value at the top of the web page, dynamically linked to Firebase, that shows the total number of links in your Firebase
 - Clean up the insert/edit form in the application using Bootstrap's CSS classes for forms: http://www.getbootstrap.com
 - In addition to the Name, Website and Description columns, modify your form and your Firebase to store a Rating value. *This will be a simple integer value entered directly into the insert/edit form.*


###Get Crazy###
Once you have all of the mandatory customization steps down (*yawn*), it's time to get crazy. Come up with two or three more features or enhancements that prove your creativity and your basic knowledge of the involved frameworks.

###Show It Off###
Now that you've gone crazy, you need to show it to us. Create your own public repository on GitHub with your version of the sample project and share the link with us. It's time for us to see what you've come up with.

###Assessment Criteria###
 - **Creativity:** did you color between the lines or think outside the box?
 - **Attention to Detail:** did you leave bugs in the code or quirkiness in the UI?
